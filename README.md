### With Python via compiling (possible on Mac too, but instructions here are for Windows)

2. Download the files by clicking on the green button that says 'Code' at the top of this page and clicking on 'Download zip'
3. Extract the zip into its own folder
4. In the path navigation, click an empty space and type `cmd` to open Terminal in the directory
5. Type `py gui.py` and press Enter
6. Alternatively, you can just double click the `run mca.bat` file, which does pretty much what steps 4-5 did.
